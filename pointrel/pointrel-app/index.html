    <title>Twirlip: Interesting starting points all using Pointrel</title>
</head>
<body>
  <a href="http://www.twirlip.com">Twirlip version 0.2.0</a> using the Pointrel Data Repository System <a href="https://github.com/pdfernhout/Pointrel20130202">(Pointrel20130202)</a>
  <br><br>
The Pointrel System can be seen as a dynamic Content Management System (CMS) and can support user-extensible data types and client-side JavaScript applications to process that data.
A first aspiration for this system is to support small workgroups collaborating on some project using an archive,
where the archive could potentially be replicated among participants in a git-like DVCS way.
A second aspiration is eventually making possible federating those workgroup archives as desired into global-scale knowledge repositories.
As a brief conceptual overview, this version of the Pointrel system supports five broad services on the server side.
<ul>
<li>Storing files which are then retrievable by a combination of their SHA-256 hash, size, and file-type extension.</li>
<li>Automatically creating indexes of some of those files that are in JSON with a specific indexing field and a specific extension.</li>
<li>Copying specific resources into a web-server accessible location and giving them new names (the "publish" part).</li>
<li>Adding to user-created append-only "journal" files.</li>
<li>Changing "variables" which are tags that refer to some specific resource;
these resources are typically JSON which can be interpreted as if it were an object pointing to other resources,
such as an element in a linked list of versions of some file being edited.</li>
</ul>
<p>The client side in JavaScript defines interfaces to communicate with those services using AJAX techniques by passing JSON messages.
A few demonstration mini-applications are included mostly for testing and bootstrapping purposes in the "bootstrap" directory.
These include an editor (using ace) which can store new versions of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resource files
and also publish them to a web-server-accessible area of the site.</p>
<p>
Together, these services provide the infrastructure of what might be thought of as an open-ended <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PointrelWiki">wiki-like</a> system.
One thing that differentiates this from a convential text-based wiki is the inclusion of tools to support client-side JavaScript
applications that process user-contributed data in dynamic ways.
It is hoped that a community of interested individuals will use these tools to expand a system for public intelligence and civic sensemaking named "Twirlip".
The Twirlip collaboration will hopefully be a co-evolution of knowledge, tools, processes, and human learning to support creating and maintaining secure healthy communities,
such as talked about by <a href="http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/vision-highlights.html">Doug Engelbart</a>" in regards to
Dynamic Knowledge Repositories, Open Hyperdocument Systems, Bootstrapping, and Augment, and also as represented by
Dee Hock's <a href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Chaordic_Organizations_-_Characteristics">Chaordic Commons</a>.
